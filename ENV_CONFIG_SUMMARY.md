## 🔧 Current Status

✅ **Environment Variables:** All configured  
✅ **Build Process:** Fixed with fallback values  
⚠️ **Deployment:** Minor secret reference issue detected  

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended)
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your `nohvex-exchange` project
3. Click **Deploy** button or commit changes to trigger auto-deployment
4. Monitor build logs for success

### Option 2: Fix CLI Secret Reference
If you want to use CLI deployment:
1. Check Environment Variables in dashboard
2. Ensure no broken secret references
3. Re-add any problematic variables manually in dashboard

### Option 3: Force Redeploy
```bash
# Push a new commit to trigger deployment
git add .
git commit -m "🔐 Configure all environment variables"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

Once deployed successfully:
- ✅ Authentication will work with NextAuth
- ✅ Database connections to Neon PostgreSQL  
- ✅ Real-time crypto prices via NOWNodes API
- ✅ Trading widget with ChangeNow integration
- ✅ All fallback error handling in place
