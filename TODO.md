# TODO

- [ ] Come back and run API smoke tests for 2FA endpoints (enable/disable 2FA, verify TOTP, backup codes, recovery flow)
- [ ] Validate 2FA enrollment UX and edge cases (clock skew, reused codes, rate limits)
- [ ] Add observability for 2FA: audit log events, metrics for success/failure, alert on anomalies

Context: Selected earlier note â€” "can run a few API smoke tests for the 2FA endpoints".
